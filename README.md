# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repository contains the R code, codebook, cleaned txt file and documentation files for the Course Project in the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course.

# Files
Codebook.md contains the codebook that describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data collection.

The run_analysis.R contains the R code that can be used to do the following 5 steps outlined in the course project page.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The tidaydataset2.txt contains the output of the 5th step above.
